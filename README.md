### üß¨ About Me
I'm a bioinformatician at the VIB-UGent Center for Medical Biotechnology (CMB), where I specialize in developing and optimizing analytical and bioinformatic pipelines for diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive analyses in cancer research. As a dry lab technician in the TOBI Lab, led by Prof. Katleen De Preter, my work focuses on integrating (epi)genetic data from tissue and liquid biopsy samples to enhance precision oncology strategies.

### üõ†Ô∏è Current Projects  
**Liquid Biopsy Analysis:** Developing pipelines for analyzing circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and RNA to monitor tumor heterogeneity and treatment response.  
**Computational Deconvolution:** Creating tools to deconvolute bulk omics data, enabling the identification of specific cell populations within complex samples.  

### üß™ Skills & Tools
**Programming Languages:**
* R, Python, SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB), HTML/CSS, PHP  

**Bioinformatics & Data Analysis:**
* DNA methylation analysis (e.g., cfRRBS, EPIC array)
* Copy number variation (CNV) analysis (e.g., WiscondorX, ichorCNA)
* Computational deconvolution (bulk methylation data)

**Workflow & Pipeline Development:**
* Workflow managers: Nextflow, Snakemake
* Containerization: Docker
* Cloud/Cluster computing: SLURM, HPC environments

**Machine Learning:**
* Feature selection, classification models, unsupervised clustering

**Version Control & Collaboration:**
* Git, GitHub
   
**Operating Systems:**
* Linux/Unix environments (command-line proficiency)  

### üìö Education
* Bachelor Biomedical Sciences, Ghent University
* Advanced Bachelor of Bioinformatics, Howest Bruges
